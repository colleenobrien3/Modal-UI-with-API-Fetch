#UI Element Project
For this project, I was given an interactive UI modal template mockup to recreate using HTML and CSS. I wrote the basic structure in HTML but added most of the features, along with the functionality, with JavaScript. I used the JavaScript fetch method to pull data from the online API 'The Rick and Morty API.'
