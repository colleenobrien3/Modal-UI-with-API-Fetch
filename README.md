# Modal UI with API Fetch

For this project, I was given an interactive UI modal template mockup to recreate using HTML and CSS. I wrote the basic structure in HTML but added most of the features, along with the functionality, with Vanilla JavaScript. I used the JavaScript fetch method to pull data from the online API ['The Rick and Morty API.']('https://rickandmortyapi.com/')

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

* SublimeText

## Getting Started

Go to https://colleenobrien3.github.io/UI-Element-Project/ to view the webpage. Click on a character's image to view their bio information in a pop-up modal box. Click inside the box again to close it. Resize the page to see it's responsiveness.

## Goals

Next, I hope to create functionality for closing the box by clicking anywhere outside of the box instead of just inside of the box. I will need to implement an event listener on the rest of the page. Perhaps I will make a div around the pop up box with display equal to zero and z index less than the modal, and give it an event listener that closes the modal.
